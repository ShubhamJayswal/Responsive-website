        <h4>A wiki is run using wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine. A wiki engine
           is a type of content management system, but it differs from most other such systems,
            including blog software, in that the content is created without any defined owner or
            leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according
            to the needs of the users.[2] There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both
             standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines
              are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different
               functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing,
               adding or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control.
                Other rules may be imposed to organize content.
